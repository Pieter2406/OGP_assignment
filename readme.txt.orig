List of Issues:

* Finish test cases for World FIXED
* Review World.java invariants and Data Structures
	using methods for manipulating associated SpaceObjects in collision 
	calculations, rather than manipulating the data structures directly.
* Collisions with walls while thruster is enabled are not working correctly. FIXED
* getTimeToCollision test cases do not pass. FIXED
* Introduce timers for every powerup. FIXED (powerups now dissapear after 10 seconds)
* firing bullet close to wall creates a bullet behind the wall, revision of wall collision necessary. POSSIBLE FIX
* Powerups spawn overlapping with ships. POSSIBLE FIX
* typeCheck bug in assignment (run awesome.txt)
* bug in foreachloop (should need global variable!) which messes up typecheck
